# Hypothesis Testing using ANOVA

This hypothesis testing is to prove whether education affects income or not. The original dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis. 

The Hypotheses are
- H0 All levels of education have the same average income
- H1 The level of education has a significantly different average income

We use ANOVA Testing in this dataset because we will compare the average of all levels of education
